# Revuect

A ultra-framework, the features of which encompass both Vue and React.

Revuect is a ultra-framework, the features of which encompass both Vue and React. The framework has the same core library that the Vue2 component already has but the React component is much more complex and needs to support a Vue2.

The Vue component has been designed to support the most popular (and most stable) React components: React, Vue, Vue2, ReactVue, ReactVue2, ReactVue2. The React component is built using React.js in the React component. It is also built using [React], but the [ReactVue2] component is built using ReactVue.

The [React] implementation is built using React.js. It is also built using React, but the React
Revuect is a ultra-framework, the features of which encompass both Vue and React. The framework has been designed to make using the React components, including React-Native, easier, and easier.

With the React-Native SDK, we can easily build our custom components on top of our existing components, and react-native-react-native-es6 makes the entire process extremely easy.

The React-Native SDK

The React-Native SDK is a powerful tool for building complex components, and it’s an ideal place to start with the React-Native SDK. You will have to follow along with the React-Native SDK’s tutorial for more details. The React-Native SDK provides several features, such as the React-Native plugin, the React-Native component, the React-Native component’s React-Native component, and many more.

In this tutorial you will learn how to build your own React-Native component
Revuect is a ultra-framework, the features of which encompass both Vue and React. The framework has been designed to extend the capabilities of the existing functional web development platform, including the React components and the component lifecycle that is built upon it by the developer.

The React component lifecycle is based on the React component’s lifecycle and the components that it has evolved from are the React components and the React components and the React components and the component lifecycle. The React components and the React components and the component lifecycle are not mutually exclusive. The React components and the component lifecycle are built upon the React component’s lifecycle and components that are built upon the component lifecycle. The React components and the component lifecycle are built upon the component lifecycle and the components that they are built upon.

The React component lifecycle is designed to take care of the lifecycle of the other components and the component lifecycle. The components and components.

The framework's main components are component layouts. Each component is a component that is defined by its own component layout.

Component components are component layouts and components are component layouts. Components are components that are part of the project. Components are part of the project's components, and are part of the Revuect Material framework. Components contain components that can be rendered by a component as a component. Components that are part of the Revuect Material framework are component layouts. Components are part of the Revuect Material framework. Components contain components that can be rendered by a component as a component. Components contain components that are part of the Revuect Material framework.

## Sample

```js
import Revuect from "revuect";
import RevuectDOM from "react-dom";

function FunctionalApp() {
    const [xd, setXd] = useState("xd"); // stateful hooks.

    return (
        <h1>Hello! {xd}</h1>
    )
}

const ObjectalApp = new Revuect({
    // follow the design pattern:
    // data is a function of state
    data() {
        return {
            xd: "xd"
        };
    }

    template: `<h1>{{ xd }}</h1>`, // string-interpolation, the future of webdev
});

// Mounting a Functional Component
RevuectDOM.render(<FunctionalApp />, document.querySelector("main"));

// Mounting a Objectal App
ObjectalApp.$mount("main");
```
